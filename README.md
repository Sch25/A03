# Git is a version control system, that manages updates and changes to programs, Github uses this allowing for multiple people to work on code and backtrack to older versions of it if desired by the team. 
# Webstorm is an IDE that can connect and integreate with GitHub provided a git.exe is installed as well.
# A repository is the location that data and systems are stored and managed.
# A remote repository is one that a team commits changes to and fetch from, cloneing makes a copy of a repository, committing is saving the changes to the repository, pushing uploads the changes to a remote repository from the local one, pulling is simmilar except the remote repository takes from a local repository, branches are different chains of the same project that stem from the main branch, merging is taking the branches outside of the main one an combining them and their changes, a merge conflict is when git can't automatically merge the branches requiring portions to be done manually, fetch grabs changes, files etc. from the remote repository for use in a local one.
# To connect to Webstorm first download and install the program from JetBrains.com. Then download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
# To create a repository go into your Github attack and click create new repository in the drop down from the + in top right of the screen and fill out the following page.
# Connect to Webstorm by loging in or redeeming the license in Webstorm then selecting "Get from Version Control" and link the Github repository. 
# Make sure git.exe is working if not add the executable through configurations. The respoitory should be cloned to Webstorm now.
# To push the repository press ctrl+shift+k and login before pushing to github.
# To get the web page go to settings in your GitHub and scroll down to GitHub Pages and selecting "master branch".
